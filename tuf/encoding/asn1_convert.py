  Recursive (base case: datatype is ASN.1 version of int, str, or bytes)

  Converts an object into an asn1crypto-compatible ASN.1 representation of that
  object, using asn1crypto functionality.  In the process, we might have to do
  some data surgery, in part because ASN.1 does not support dictionaries.

  The scenarios we handle are these:
    1- datatype is primitive
    2- datatype is "list-like" (subclass of SequenceOf/SetOf) and:
      2a- data is a list
      2b- data is a "list-like" dict
    3- datatype is "struct-like" (subclass of Sequence/Set) and data is a dict

  Scenario 1: primitive
    No recursion is necessary.  We can just convert to one of these classes
    from asn1crypto.core: Integer, VisibleString, or OctetString, based on what
    datatype is / is a subclass of.  (Note that issubclass() also returns True
    if the classes given are the same; i.e. a class is its own subclass.)


  Scenario 2: "list-like" (datatype is/subclasses SequenceOf/SetOf)
    The resulting object will be integer-indexed and may be converted from
    either a list or a dict.  Length might be variable See below.

    Scenario 2a: "list-like" from list
      Each element in data will map directly into an element of the returned
      object, with the same integer indices.
          e.g. data = ['some info about Robert', 'some info about Layla']
        mapping such that:
          asn1_obj[0] = some conversion of 'some info about Robert'
          asn1_obj[1] = some conversion of 'some info about Layla'

    Scenario 2b: "list-like" from dict
      Each key-value pair in data will become a 2-tuple element in the returned
      object.
          e.g. data = {'Robert': '...', 'Layla': '...'}
        mapping such that:
          asn1_obj[0] = ('Robert', '...')
          asn1_obj[1] = ('Layla', '...')


  <Returns>

  <Arguments>
